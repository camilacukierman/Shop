# Shop

Done during the ITC Program the "Plaza Sesamo Shop" is a online shop made using Angular.
The main goal was to learn how to work with Angular, and the views and the other particular things.
The app is totally intuitive for the user, specially because is made for kids to navigate and choose what they want.
The landing page shows the  avaiable products, followed by details page with the option to up in the cart.
After that, just clicking  in the paying option or going back to the main page.
